JARPG

A dungeon crawling game where you explore a dungeon, fighting monsters as you go and collecting their loot.
The combat is text and turn based.

KEY NOTE:
After a combat dialogue ends, the user must navigate to the top menu bar, select "Dungeon" and select "Return to Dungeon."
This is also explained in the in-game dialogue boxes, but can potentially be missed
