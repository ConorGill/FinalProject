public class Character {

   // private Weapon equipedWeapon; enums need to be added to the repository before these can work, change this when they are added.
   // private Armor equipedArmor;
    //private int Defense; I'm assuming this is an int, but on the design DIA file it is just defense, so I'm leaving this commented out for now.
    //Constructors go here
